Modified Resources:
Survival Shooter Mechanics (https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/survival-shooter-tutorial)
  I mostly simplified the code from this tutorial for my needs and incorporated recognition and interaction with various attack types
Touch Gesture Mechanics (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27712233/swipe-gestures-on-android-in-unity)
  This provided the backbone for this apps gesture system, but specific gestures are implemented to vary between different spells
